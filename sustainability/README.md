## Sustainability

---------------
-------------------
- **Climate & Net Zero** : Reducing global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to ‘net zero’ 
i.e. balance between emissions and emissions reductions
- **Clean Energy Transition** : Shifting energy production away from sources that release GHG, to 
Clean sources like Nuclear power, hydro, wind and solar etc.
- **Circular Economy** : Transforming full value chains to create a system in which waste is 
designed out entirely and the goal is net positivity—adding instead of 
extracting resources—through restorative models.
- **Responsible Value Chains** : Ethical and inclusive sourcing, End-to-end transparency and visibility
- **Sustainable Investing** : Sustainable investing balances traditional investing with environmental, 
social, and governance-related (ESG) insights to improve long-term outcomes.


------------

**Net Zero Transitions**

74 countries—accounting for more than 80 percent of global GDP and 
almost 70 percent of global CO2 emissions - & More than 3,000 companies 
have made net-zero commitments as part of the United Nation’s “Race to 
Zero” campaign.

-----------------
**Sustainable Value Chain**

Organizations must redesign the way they work to build trust through 
transparency, to embrace circularity, and to achieve net zero carbon 
emissions to achieve greater resiliency

- Circularity -Shift from linear production processes to having closed-loop 
processes with Resource Recovery
- Net Zero - Value chains must be reinvented as Net Zero. 
- Trust - bring traceability and transparency into their value chains.

------------
**Sustainability Measurement, Analytics And Performance**

The businesses that leap at the opportunity to embed sustainability data, 
decision-making and performance into everything they do will be the first 
to benefit from the set of growth opportunities that are only available to 
those who take stepwise actions toward becoming Sustainable, fast.

- Risk - Incurring higher costs if their ESG ratings are poor.
- Regulation - Governments are falling short of meeting their Paris Agreement 
targets (by 2030) and progress towards UN SDGs, 
creating urgency.
- Return - Organizations that prioritize ESG will likely see increased returns (97% 
of Investors expect to redeploy capital in response to ESG).
