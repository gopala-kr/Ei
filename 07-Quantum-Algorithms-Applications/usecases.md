#### QC Use Cases

---------------
- **Clustering Market Data**	- A stock market network often referred to as a market graph is a model in which stocks are nodes and edges represent a relationship between the stocks. The availability of high throughput electronic exchanges offering real-time low latency data feeds resulted in an electronic trading environment where computational speed is a critical component. Market graphs can be built with high frequency market data (see for example A parallel workflow for real-time correlation and clustering of high-frequency stock market data). Naturally the ability to extract information from market graphs based on high frequency data depends on the ability to perform fast calculations but important information can be contained in the solutions of computationally difficult problems. In particular while the calculation of stocks correlations according to chosen similarity technical indicators is polynomial in the number of stocks finding the largest cluster or clique of stocks that exhibit highly correlated trading patterns is NP-hard. The max-clique problem is in the class of problems that can be tackled by QAOA and QADI.https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03890.pdf	
-------------------
-	**Credit Scoring Classification**	 - 	Credit scoring and classification is a significant problem in computational finance. U.S. household debt alone is estimated to be around $14 trillion (US FED 2016). According to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 547 U.S. lending institutions have failed in the 15 years since 2001 with non-performing loans being a major cause even if according to the 2016 Credit Access Survey by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York approximately 40% of U.S. credit applications are rejected. Feature selection is used to reduce the number of variables input to a classifier in order to simplify the interpretation of the results of the classifier to provide flexibility and ease of integration into specialized applications and to avoid possible costs for unnecessary data which would only be introducing noise. Mathematically features selection consists in identifying a subset of ùêæ influential and independent features in a larger initial set of ùëÅ features. The possible number of subsets of size ùêæ grows exponentially with ùëÅ. The feature selection problem can be expressed in terms of a quadratic optimisation and QAOA and QADI can therefore be employed and run on a quantum annealer https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03890.pdf	
-------------------
-	**Dynamic Portfolios**	- A central problem in finance is the optimal allocation of capital across a pool of assets. The discrete dynamic portfolio optimisation problem can be summarised as the problem of investing in a set of ùëÅ assets with an investment horizon divided into ùëá time steps. Given a forecast of future returns and the risk of each asset at each time step the problem consists in deciding how much to invest in each asset at each time step taking into account transaction costs. The continuous-variable version of the problem is easier but it is of limited use for assets that can only be traded in large lots. One approach to the discrete problem could be to compute the portfolio that maximizes the expected return subject to a level of risk at each time step. This would result in a series of ‚Äústatically optimal‚Äù portfolios. However not only the single-period discrete portfolio optimization is NP-hard but the approach would not necessarily generate portfolios that are ‚Äúglobally optimal‚Äù as the overall risk-adjusted return can be greater than the combined risk-adjusted returns from the series of ‚Äústatically optimal‚Äù portfolios. An optimal solution over ùëá can be found by expressing the problem as a quadratic optimization as in Solving the optimal trading trajectory problem using a quantum annealer reducing the problem once more to the methods of QAOA and QADI https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03890.pdf

-------------------
-	**Capital Budgeting** -	In order to fairly allocate costs and gains across a coalition of actors; when forecasting capital budgets; one commonly used method is the calculation of a Shapely Value. Graver Basis has been proved to be a high quality method of calculating Shapely Values; but its computational complexity scales exponentially with the size of the problem. We would like to use quantum computing to generate Graver bases; and use the resulting high quality Shapely values to collaborate on capital budgeting (e.g. multiple corporations sharing production lines). https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04215.pdf

Using a quantum computer to optimize intervention checkpoints could help the general population in a crisis by expediting model calculation. With connecting dominating set we can identify the likelihood of transferrence between two individual because the CDS identifies the distance between two nodes. https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e1/c5/a3/d6b140b0ecb77f/US20170286852A1.pdf

-------------------
- **Optimal Feed Blending** -	Commercial feed blending is a complex process consisting of many potential raw ingredients and final products. The sheer number of daily orders and final products at a typical feed mill means that raw ingredients cannot be mixed to directly produce final products in an economical fashion. As a result; the intermediate production of pellets with prespecified nutritional content is a necessity that makes the feed blending problem highly nonlinear. We would like a fundamental tool for optimization problems requiring variable discretization such as commercial feed blending. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4780970_Optimal_Feed_Mill_Blending

The proposed method provides exponential speedup calculating gradient descent; while retaining the classical gradients at each iteration. We would like to empower data analysts by offsetting the significant cost of training LR models. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03834.pdf

The problem however is a bit more complex; if we would like to include fairness; priority or distribution parameters into a scheduling model the complexity grows exponentially in the number of sub parameters (time between shifts; different break lengths; long week vs short weeks; taxing vs simple jobs). We would like a generalizable model to encode these workplace priorities. https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08479

-------------------
- **Virtual Screening** -	Virtual screening is the process in which small molecules are compared to find new drug candidates. This happens at the very beginning of the drug discovery process. This is important because it takes over 10yrs and costs over $2B to bring a new drug to market. Using quantum computers we can compare molecules using graph methods and get better matches. Additionally as quantum computers are able to take on more complex problems we can screen for drugs never searched before. Molecular comparison is also useful in other areas of chemistry.https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00352

-------------------
- **Image Segmentation**	- Representing image pixel by pixel using classical information requires an enormous amount of computational resources. Hence; exploring methods to represent images in a different paradigm of information is important. In this work; we study the representation of images in Quantum Information. The main motivation for this pursuit is the ability of storing N bits of classical information in only log(2N) quantum bits (qubits). https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11042

It has been shown to have applications in meteorology and oceanography; project prioritization and selection; seismic facies analysis for oil and gas exploration and structural failure analysis. SOFM can be formulated as quantum-assisted clustering analysis. Hybrid classical/quantum-assisted clustering algorithms are logarithmic in the size of the data; and appear to be more robust than classical counterparts as noise is added. We would like to model one of these use cases as a hybrid quantum-assisted cluster analysis problem. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02886.pdf
