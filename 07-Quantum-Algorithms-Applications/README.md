      Unlike classical digital states (which are discrete), a qubit is continuous-valued, describable by a direction on the Bloch sphere. Despite being continuously valued in this way, a qubit is the smallest possible unit of quantum information, and despite the qubit state being continuously-valued, it is impossible to measure the value precisely. 
      
      Five famous theorems describe the limits on manipulation of quantum information.

      - no-teleportation theorem: which states that a qubit cannot be (wholly) converted into classical bits; that is, it cannot "read".
      - no-cloning theorem: which prevents an arbitrary qubit from being copied.
      - no-deleting theorem: which prevents an arbitrary qubit from being deleted.
      - no-broadcast theorem: Although a single qubit can be transported from place to place (e.g. via quantum teleportation), it cannot             be delivered to multiple recipients.
      - no-hiding theorem: which demonstrates the conservation of quantum information.
      
      These theorems prove that quantum information within the universe is conserved.They open up possibilities in quantum information       processing.
      
      The state of a qubit contains all of its information. This state is frequently expressed as a vector on the Bloch sphere. This state can be changed by applying linear transformations or quantum gates to them. These unitary transformations are described as rotations on the Bloch Sphere. While classical gates correspond to the familiar operations of Boolean logic, quantum gates are physical unitary operators.
      
      In some cases quantum algorithms can be used to perform computations faster than in any known classical algorithm. The most famous example of this is Shor's algorithm that can factor numbers in polynomial time, compared to the best classical algorithms that take sub-exponential time. As factorization is an important part of the safety of RSA encryption, Shor's algorithm sparked the new field of post-quantum cryptography that tries to find encryption schemes that remain safe even when quantum computers are in play.Other examples of algorithms that demonstrate quantum supremacy include Grover's search algorithm, where the quantum algorithm gives a quadratic speed-up over the best possible classical algorithm. The complexity class of problems efficiently solvable by a quantum computer is known as BQP
      
      In the field of quantum information theory, the quantum systems studied are abstracted away from any real world counterpart. A qubit might for instance physically be a photon in a linear optical quantum computer, an ion in a trapped ion quantum computer, or it might be a large collection of atoms as in a superconducting quantum computer. Regardless of the physical implementation, the limits and features of qubits implied by quantum information theory hold as all these systems are all mathematically described by the same apparatus of density matrices over the complex numbers.
