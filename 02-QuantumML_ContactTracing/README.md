      QCs require controlling and maintaining the quantum behavior of their qubits. Because temperature
      is often an obstacle to achieving this stability, many physical implementations of QCs are done at
      extremely low temperatures.
      
      Atoms stop moving entirely at absolute zero (-273.15° on the Celsius scale; -459.67° on the
      Fahrenheit scale; 0 on the Kelvin scale). Nitrogen turns liquid at 77K, and helium liquefies at about
      4K. As of 2020, the most common physical implementations (devices from Google, Intel, IBM and
      D-wave) rely on temperatures well below 4K—usually around 0.015K (15 millikelvin), although
      some are operating at even lower microkelvin levels.Recent hot quibits are at high as 1.5k(2020).
      Such machines and their associated cooling systems, by necessity, weigh thousands of kilograms, are the
      size of a small car, cost millions of dollars, and use many kilowatts of power. This is not just true today; 
      any QC that requires millikelvin temperatures will continue to be roughly that large, expensive, and 
      energy-consuming.
      
      There are, however, proposed physical implementations that require “merely” the very cold
      temperatures that can be achieved with liquid nitrogen. These machines would be cheaper and
      smaller, albeit still larger and more expensive than almost all classical computers. There are also
      hopes for room-temperature QC technologies, but none of these have yet been demonstrated to
      work at more than one or two physical qubits.
      
      Failing those room-temperature solutions, it becomes clear that we are not going to have quantum
      computing on our smartphones any near term, except through the cloud!
