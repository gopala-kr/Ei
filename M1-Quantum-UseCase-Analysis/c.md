NEW MATERIALS DISCOVERY

One of the most promising uses of quantum computing is the simulation and discovery of the properties of new materials and active products (for chemistry and pharmacy), through the simulation of atomic interactions. Projects based around this notion are in progress at Dow Chemicals and at Airbus.

SUSTAINABLE FERTILIZERS

Current artificial fertilizers are based on ammonia, made via the Haber process. They use high temperatures and pressures and are energy-intensive. Quantum computing could help scientists understand the Haber process at the molecular level, and start-up Rigetti points to its value in making fertilizers.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/109882685-30b1b280-7c72-11eb-990c-e6a98fb7ed65.png)
