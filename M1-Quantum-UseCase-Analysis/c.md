Quantum simulators will enable the quantum approach to computation to advance faster than pure quantum hardware and pure quantum algorithms are currently advancing
Simulate complex chemical bonds and predict the structures of new drugs, semiconductors, and efficient catalysts.
Solve materials science problems (e.g. next-gen materials)  

Quantum computers can be used to simulate other quantum systems, such as complex molecules, to predict the outcome of chemical processes. Simulating complex quantum phenomena could be one of the most important applications of quantum computing. 
A key envisioned use is simulating molecular properties. In the long run, this can lead to advances in materials improvement and drug discovery. In quantum chemistry, quantum simulators could be used to simulate protein folding (misfolded proteins can cause diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s).

Quantum chemistry attempts to understand the complicated bonds and reactions of molecules with the help of quantum mechanics. Many details of chemical processes cannot be simulated even with the largest and fastest supercomputers. By modeling these processes with the help of quantum computers, scientists expect a better understanding of chemical bonds and reactions to apply to drug discovery, materials science and medicine.

Quantum computing has the potential to help design new materials and industrial processes by precisely predicting the behavior of molecules, or even discovering new molecules. This could lead to the design of more efficient electric car batteries, new drug discovery, better artificial fertilizer production, carbon capture for air pollution, among so many other things. Quantum algorithms are the tools that tell quantum computers what to do; Trotter-type algorithms, for example, are used for molecular simulation or comparison, however their susceptibility to noise means that these applications won’t be practical for many years. In the meantime, the performances of classical algorithms are being enhanced by creating new, quantum-inspired algorithms.

Quantum-inspired molecular comparison refers to the use of structural molecular comparison algorithms that can be implemented and run on conventional computers, whose design is inspired by concepts from quantum information processing. Molecular comparison is a crucial part of early-phase drug design and discovery that involves intensive computational methods to review molecule matches and predict the positive effects of a therapy or drug while reducing negative side effects. 
Characteristics

Quantum-inspired methods use parallelization and problem-reformulation in algorithms and hardware
Enhance classical computing using quantum-inspired algorithms (not fully-quantum).
Perform graph similarity; compare two or more graphs to detect common patterns (e.g. find shared traits in molecules).

Today, it takes pharmaceutical companies at least 10 years and often billions of dollars to discover a new drug and bring it to market. Improving the front end of the process with quantum computing has the potential to  dramatically cut costs and time to market, repurpose pre-approved drugs more easily for new applications, and empower computational chemists to make new discoveries faster that could lead to cures for a range of diseases. Furthermore, the quantum simulation of chemical processes could in the future help solve problems in chemistry and thus, for example, give new impulses for materials science, medicine, and industrial chemistry.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/109884969-b6832d00-7c75-11eb-8c2d-484d225e4b73.png)

BT WORKS TO SECURE ITS NETWORK

BT announced an ‘unhackable’ quantum-secured network in June 2018. The collaborative project was led by the Quantum Communications Hub, part of the UK National Quantum Technologies Programme. 
The quantum link itself is said to be virtually “unhackable” because it relies on the use of single particles of light (photons), to transmit data encryption “keys” across the fibre. Should this communication be intercepted, the sender will be able to tell that the link has been tampered with and the stolen photons cannot then be used as part of the key, rendering the data stream incomprehensible to the hacker.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/110008683-00d1e000-7d42-11eb-9fa1-981fb94a73db.png)
