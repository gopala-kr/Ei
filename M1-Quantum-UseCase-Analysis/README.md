----------------------------


#### QC Use Cases

---------------
- **Clustering Market Data**	- A stock market network often referred to as a market graph is a model in which stocks are nodes and edges represent a relationship between the stocks. The availability of high throughput electronic exchanges offering real-time low latency data feeds resulted in an electronic trading environment where computational speed is a critical component. Market graphs can be built with high frequency market data (see for example A parallel workflow for real-time correlation and clustering of high-frequency stock market data). Naturally the ability to extract information from market graphs based on high frequency data depends on the ability to perform fast calculations but important information can be contained in the solutions of computationally difficult problems. In particular while the calculation of stocks correlations according to chosen similarity technical indicators is polynomial in the number of stocks finding the largest cluster or clique of stocks that exhibit highly correlated trading patterns is NP-hard. The max-clique problem is in the class of problems that can be tackled by QAOA and QADI.https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03890.pdf	
-------------------
-	**Credit Scoring Classification**	 - 	Credit scoring and classification is a significant problem in computational finance. U.S. household debt alone is estimated to be around $14 trillion (US FED 2016). According to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 547 U.S. lending institutions have failed in the 15 years since 2001 with non-performing loans being a major cause even if according to the 2016 Credit Access Survey by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York approximately 40% of U.S. credit applications are rejected. Feature selection is used to reduce the number of variables input to a classifier in order to simplify the interpretation of the results of the classifier to provide flexibility and ease of integration into specialized applications and to avoid possible costs for unnecessary data which would only be introducing noise. Mathematically features selection consists in identifying a subset of ùêæ influential and independent features in a larger initial set of ùëÅ features. The possible number of subsets of size ùêæ grows exponentially with ùëÅ. The feature selection problem can be expressed in terms of a quadratic optimisation and QAOA and QADI can therefore be employed and run on a quantum annealer https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03890.pdf	
-------------------
-	**Dynamic Portfolios**	- A central problem in finance is the optimal allocation of capital across a pool of assets. The discrete dynamic portfolio optimisation problem can be summarised as the problem of investing in a set of ùëÅ assets with an investment horizon divided into ùëá time steps. Given a forecast of future returns and the risk of each asset at each time step the problem consists in deciding how much to invest in each asset at each time step taking into account transaction costs. The continuous-variable version of the problem is easier but it is of limited use for assets that can only be traded in large lots. One approach to the discrete problem could be to compute the portfolio that maximizes the expected return subject to a level of risk at each time step. This would result in a series of ‚Äústatically optimal‚Äù portfolios. However not only the single-period discrete portfolio optimization is NP-hard but the approach would not necessarily generate portfolios that are ‚Äúglobally optimal‚Äù as the overall risk-adjusted return can be greater than the combined risk-adjusted returns from the series of ‚Äústatically optimal‚Äù portfolios. An optimal solution over ùëá can be found by expressing the problem as a quadratic optimization as in Solving the optimal trading trajectory problem using a quantum annealer reducing the problem once more to the methods of QAOA and QADI https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03890.pdf	
-------------------

-------------------
- **Cutting Stock** -	Cutting materials into a set of desired shapes while minimizing waste is an NP-Hard problem reducable to the knapsack problem. Large steel plate cutting factories are moving from producer-centric models to consumer-centric models where desired shapes and quantities frequently change. Formulated as a knapsack problem; we would like produce an optimal production design - production steps and related intermediate products. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1417/64b5e86dc6c2647dfce48098794c79d5a38b.pdf?_ga=2.115996801.665139585.1560375598-183914737.1555621357	
-------------------
-	**Capital Budgeting** -	In order to fairly allocate costs and gains across a coalition of actors; when forecasting capital budgets; one commonly used method is the calculation of a Shapely Value. Graver Basis has been proved to be a high quality method of calculating Shapely Values; but its computational complexity scales exponentially with the size of the problem. We would like to use quantum computing to generate Graver bases; and use the resulting high quality Shapely values to collaborate on capital budgeting (e.g. multiple corporations sharing production lines). https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04215.pdf

-------------------
- **Infectious Disease Spread Control** -	There are multiple types of infectious diseases that are spread through different channels. Preventions of spreading disesases can be represented as a graph problem. Modeling this could decrease the likelihood of outbreaks. Using a quantum computer to optimize intervention checkpoints could help the general population in a crisis by expediting model calculation. With connecting dominating set we can identify the likelihood of transferrence between two individual because the CDS identifies the distance between two nodes. https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e1/c5/a3/d6b140b0ecb77f/US20170286852A1.pdf

-------------------
- **DNA Sequencing**	- DNA Sequencing involves multiple trials; with multiple positive sequences per segment being used to calculate the result.

-------------------
- **Optimal Feed Blending** -	Commercial feed blending is a complex process consisting of many potential raw ingredients and final products. The sheer number of daily orders and final products at a typical feed mill means that raw ingredients cannot be mixed to directly produce final products in an economical fashion. As a result; the intermediate production of pellets with prespecified nutritional content is a necessity that makes the feed blending problem highly nonlinear. We would like a fundamental tool for optimization problems requiring variable discretization such as commercial feed blending. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4780970_Optimal_Feed_Mill_Blending	
-------------------
- **Fraud Detection** -	Two widely used algorithms in classical anomaly detection are the kernel principal component analysis and the one-class support vector machine. We would like to employ corresponding quantum algorithms to detect anomalies in quantum states. https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07405	
-------------------
- **Gasoline Blending** -	Commercial gas blending; like feed blending; requires mixtures exactly suited to the needs of many different gasoline powered engines.

-------------------
- **Mortgage & Insurance Behavior Classification** -	Logistic regression is a key function at the heart of many risk prediction ML models. LR entails an iterative gradient descent method; and is quite time consuming when processing big data sets. The proposed method provides exponential speedup calculating gradient descent; while retaining the classical gradients at each iteration. We would like to empower data analysts by offsetting the significant cost of training LR models. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03834.pdf	
-------------------

-------------------
- **Staffing Scheduling** -	Shift and staffing scheduling is a well researched task that is today handled by shift and staffing managers. The problem however is a bit more complex; if we would like to include fairness; priority or distribution parameters into a scheduling model the complexity grows exponentially in the number of sub parameters (time between shifts; different break lengths; long week vs short weeks; taxing vs simple jobs). We would like a generalizable model to encode these workplace priorities. https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08479

-------------------
- **Virtual Screening** -	Virtual screening is the process in which small molecules are compared to find new drug candidates. This happens at the very beginning of the drug discovery process. This is important because it takes over 10yrs and costs over $2B to bring a new drug to market. Using quantum computers we can compare molecules using graph methods and get better matches. Additionally as quantum computers are able to take on more complex problems we can screen for drugs never searched before. Molecular comparison is also useful in other areas of chemistry.https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00352

-------------------
- **GSM Networks**	- Security deficiencies and bugs in Authentication of SIM cards in Global Systems for Mobile (GSM) have led us to present new protocols for these networks using the principles of quantum cryptography. We would like to apply these protocols to known high risk network hand offs in order to prevent attacks such as SIM logging. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02081.pdf	
-------------------
- **Image Segmentation**	- Representing image pixel by pixel using classical information requires an enormous amount of computational resources. Hence; exploring methods to represent images in a different paradigm of information is important. In this work; we study the representation of images in Quantum Information. The main motivation for this pursuit is the ability of storing N bits of classical information in only log(2N) quantum bits (qubits). https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11042	
-------------------
- **Data Processing** -	The self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a NN approach focusing on dimensionality reduction. It has been shown to have applications in meteorology and oceanography; project prioritization and selection; seismic facies analysis for oil and gas exploration and structural failure analysis. SOFM can be formulated as quantum-assisted clustering analysis. Hybrid classical/quantum-assisted clustering algorithms are logarithmic in the size of the data; and appear to be more robust than classical counterparts as noise is added. We would like to model one of these use cases as a hybrid quantum-assisted cluster analysis problem. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02886.pdf

One of the most widely used methods is Huffman coding which guarantees constructing a tree in O(n^2) and then traversing it in O(n). Huffman coding inspired methods show up to 80% reduction in the space required to store the graphs as compared to using the adjacency matrix. We would like to offset the cost of huffman coding using quantum computing; specifically quantum-inspired Huffman coding. https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5130	
-------------------
- **Satellite Operations** - Satellite communication relies on line of site to relay data around the globe; bypassing ground based infrastructure. This nework of satellites is constantly moving; with signal quality relying on contiuous optimal positioning. The network can be formulated as a graph coloring problem.

Quantum simulators will enable the quantum approach to computation to advance faster than pure quantum hardware and pure quantum algorithms are currently advancing
Simulate complex chemical bonds and predict the structures of new drugs, semiconductors, and efficient catalysts.
Solve materials science problems (e.g. next-gen materials)  

Quantum computers can be used to simulate other quantum systems, such as complex molecules, to predict the outcome of chemical processes. Simulating complex quantum phenomena could be one of the most important applications of quantum computing. 
A key envisioned use is simulating molecular properties. In the long run, this can lead to advances in materials improvement and drug discovery. In quantum chemistry, quantum simulators could be used to simulate protein folding (misfolded proteins can cause diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs). 



Quantum chemistry attempts to understand the complicated bonds and reactions of molecules with the help of quantum mechanics. Many details of chemical processes cannot be simulated even with the largest and fastest supercomputers. By modeling these processes with the help of quantum computers, scientists expect a better understanding of chemical bonds and reactions to apply to drug discovery, materials science and medicine. 
Characteristics


Quantum computing has the potential to help design new materials and industrial processes by precisely predicting the behavior of molecules, or even discovering new molecules. This could lead to the design of more efficient electric car batteries, new drug discovery, better artificial fertilizer production, carbon capture for air pollution, among so many other things. Quantum algorithms are the tools that tell quantum computers what to do; Trotter-type algorithms, for example, are used for molecular simulation or comparison, however their susceptibility to noise means that these applications won‚Äôt be practical for many years. In the meantime, the performances of classical algorithms are being enhanced by creating new, quantum-inspired algorithms.



Quantum-inspired molecular comparison refers to the use of structural molecular comparison algorithms that can be implemented and run on conventional computers, whose design is inspired by concepts from quantum information processing. Molecular comparison is a crucial part of early-phase drug design and discovery that involves intensive computational methods to review molecule matches and predict the positive effects of a therapy or drug while reducing negative side effects. 
Characteristics

Quantum-inspired methods use parallelization and problem-reformulation in algorithms and hardware
Enhance classical computing using quantum-inspired algorithms (not fully-quantum).
Perform graph similarity; compare two or more graphs to detect common patterns (e.g. find shared traits in molecules).




Quantum-inspired algorithms will enable the quantum approach to computation to advance faster than pure quantum hardware and pure quantum algorithms are currently advancing.
Solve real life problems faster than classical algorithms. Potential to analyze larger-scale molecules more quickly and cost effectively.
Predict the positive effects of a therapy or drug while reducing negative side effects. 




Today, it takes pharmaceutical companies at least 10 years and often billions of dollars to discover a new drug and bring it to market. Improving the front end of the process with quantum computing has the potential to  dramatically cut costs and time to market, repurpose pre-approved drugs more easily for new applications, and empower computational chemists to make new discoveries faster that could lead to cures for a range of diseases. Furthermore, the quantum simulation of chemical processes could in the future help solve problems in chemistry and thus, for example, give new impulses for materials science, medicine, and industrial chemistry.

BT WORKS TO SECURE ITS NETWORK

BT announced an ‚Äòunhackable‚Äô quantum-secured network in June 2018. The collaborative project was led by the Quantum Communications Hub, part of the UK National Quantum Technologies Programme. 
The quantum link itself is said to be virtually ‚Äúunhackable‚Äù because it relies on the use of single particles of light (photons), to transmit data encryption ‚Äúkeys‚Äù across the fibre. Should this communication be intercepted, the sender will be able to tell that the link has been tampered with and the stolen photons cannot then be used as part of the key, rendering the data stream incomprehensible to the hacker.
