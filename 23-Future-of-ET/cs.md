###### Cloud Office

Essential Services at Government of British Columbia

Government of British Columbia, Office of CIO established the BC Developers’ Exchange (BCDevExchange) to support collaboration between government and citizens using open source tools. It provides a cloud native experience for services such as education, healthcare, social services and economic development to its 4.6 million residents![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232447-08677380-85e3-11eb-8c42-bbe76b4b67bc.png)


Confidence to securely collaborate from anywhere

Agri-food leader Amador used Forcepoint Email Security Cloud to eliminate spam and malware before it reaches the company network and Web Security to protect both office and remote workers from phishing sites, spyware, and malicious code.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232471-15846280-85e3-11eb-9326-20fe79610f6d.png)



Process improvement at Scottish Waters

Scottish Waters leverages Oracle ERP Cloud to run its critical back-office functions leading shorter order lead times, reduced customer complaints, and improved customer satisfaction levels.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232497-1fa66100-85e3-11eb-9e64-d6ad38c3adeb.png)


Microsoft Office 365

Accenture was looking to improve the efficiency of its IT services, without adding extra costs. Accenture had been using a suite of on-premises services that included Microsoft Office and Office Communicator, but came to realize that running services on-premises was an expensive option. Avanade and Accenture, in under 12 months, completed one of the biggest ever deployments of Microsoft Office 365, involving more than 290,000 users and 11,000 sites across 54 countries. 13,000 Microsoft SharePoint Online sites were created, 130 TBs of data moved with users experiencing additional functionality promptly.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232518-28973280-85e3-11eb-9d7f-0ed652a504c8.png)


Amazon Chime

Brooks Brothers is the oldest men’s clothier in the United States, with 270 stores in the US and Canada. The company faced challenges regarding speed of deployment for new SAP implementation, and were overly reliant on email. Amazon Chime provides its users with a single application for online meetings, calls, and chat, available across all devices. Brooks Brothers was also able to retire multiple legacy applications. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232536-32b93100-85e3-11eb-9ed5-da197dbce0b0.png)


Google G Suite

Morrisons is one of the largest supermarket chains in the United Kingdom, with 120,000 staff across more than 500 sites. Previously, Morrisons would print half a million sheets of paper each week and file them in over 3,000 filing cabinets. Using Google G Suite, employees could now collaborate in Docs and collect information rapidly using Forms, reducing the paperwork required. Instead of VPNs and outdated handheld devices, employees could use G Suite on any available device.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232559-3b116c00-85e3-11eb-9694-6291974c7eaf.png)


IBM Connections

Cloudhop, the managed service provider, develops and delivers solutions that help organizations across Africa and the Middle East enhance productivity, reduce costs and uncover valuable insights in their data. Cloudhop wanted to offer social collaboration tools that could scale to support multinational organizations, in order to attract larger clients, and keep them. Using IBM Connections Cloud and IBM Watson Workspace, integrated and security-rich capabilities are delivered, supporting teams of 10 to 10,000.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232582-45cc0100-85e3-11eb-9022-161c26d2a263.png)


MERGER & ACQUISITIONS

Shell used a combination of Salesforce platform, Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Office 365 to divest selected downstream businesses in and enabled these businesses to operate on a new IT platform, separate from the Shell global IT landscape. Using these predominant cloud platforms, Shell achieved a successful IT merger and acquisition implementation, allowing the deals to be implemented in a faster, more flexible and cost-effective way than would have been possible using a traditional approach.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232598-4e243c00-85e3-11eb-917e-6a17425945d3.png)

VR Training

Walmart, the American multinational retailer, is using VR headsets to train employees across the United States, in partnership with VR start-up STRIVR. Employees at a Walmart training academy can experience real-world scenarios using an Oculus headset, with the headset linked to a video screen so that the instructor and other students can also view the experience.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111233075-37cab000-85e4-11eb-957c-1abf03985ae3.png)

Augmented Reality

Although it has been discontinued in the consumer market, Google Glass has been used in the manufacturing industry to assist workers. Employees at ACGO, an American agricultural equipment manufacturer, use Google Glass in case they forget a set of instructions while working on a piece of equipment, or to bring up a required manual, photo or video.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111233104-46b16280-85e4-11eb-9980-1da180ef789d.png)

VR Collaboration

Volkswagen partnered with Innoactive, the German VR training company, to train 10,000 staff across several brands and locations. The Innoactive HB SDK is used and optimized for the HTC Vive Pro and the Volkswagen Group Digital Reality Hub is a VR platform that helps employees collaborate across the Audi, SEAT, Skoda and Volkswagen brands. Multiple users  can collaborate simultaneously while located physically in different offices. There are now more than 30 VR training simulations.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111233132-503aca80-85e4-11eb-9d81-99257679fb2e.png)

DNA Storage

Catalog claims to be the first company to have developed a solution to make DNA data storage commercially viable. Catalog uses enzymes to create proprietary-encoded DNA strands and is currently developing the way to scale up such a system.
The first prototype machine, which is on schedule to be completed by early 2019, will be able to encode a full terabit per day and by 2022, the company expects to be able to increase that to a petabit — a 1000-fold improvement. That should make the process competitive for archival storage, such as medical and legal records as well as storing film databases at movie studios.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111886630-1ba18700-89c7-11eb-8e14-50c4fa3b4844.png)
