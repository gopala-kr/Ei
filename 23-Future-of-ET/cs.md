Microsoft Office 365

Accenture was looking to improve the efficiency of its IT services, without adding extra costs. Accenture had been using a suite of on-premises services that included Microsoft Office and Office Communicator, but came to realize that running services on-premises was an expensive option. Avanade and Accenture, in under 12 months, completed one of the biggest ever deployments of Microsoft Office 365, involving more than 290,000 users and 11,000 sites across 54 countries. 13,000 Microsoft SharePoint Online sites were created, 130 TBs of data moved with users experiencing additional functionality promptly.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232518-28973280-85e3-11eb-9d7f-0ed652a504c8.png)


Amazon Chime

Brooks Brothers is the oldest men’s clothier in the United States, with 270 stores in the US and Canada. The company faced challenges regarding speed of deployment for new SAP implementation, and were overly reliant on email. Amazon Chime provides its users with a single application for online meetings, calls, and chat, available across all devices. Brooks Brothers was also able to retire multiple legacy applications. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232536-32b93100-85e3-11eb-9ed5-da197dbce0b0.png)


Google G Suite

Morrisons is one of the largest supermarket chains in the United Kingdom, with 120,000 staff across more than 500 sites. Previously, Morrisons would print half a million sheets of paper each week and file them in over 3,000 filing cabinets. Using Google G Suite, employees could now collaborate in Docs and collect information rapidly using Forms, reducing the paperwork required. Instead of VPNs and outdated handheld devices, employees could use G Suite on any available device.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232559-3b116c00-85e3-11eb-9694-6291974c7eaf.png)


IBM Connections

Cloudhop, the managed service provider, develops and delivers solutions that help organizations across Africa and the Middle East enhance productivity, reduce costs and uncover valuable insights in their data.

Using IBM Connections Cloud and IBM Watson Workspace, integrated and security-rich capabilities are delivered, supporting teams of 10 to 10,000.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232582-45cc0100-85e3-11eb-9022-161c26d2a263.png)


MERGER & ACQUISITIONS

Shell used a combination of Salesforce platform, Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Office 365 to divest selected downstream businesses in and enabled these businesses to operate on a new IT platform, separate from the Shell global IT landscape. Using these predominant cloud platforms, Shell achieved a successful IT merger and acquisition implementation, allowing the deals to be implemented in a faster, more flexible and cost-effective way than would have been possible using a traditional approach.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111232598-4e243c00-85e3-11eb-917e-6a17425945d3.png)
