                     <span>In March 2012, Rebecca Park identified an excellent business opportunity while she was a first-year MBA student at Wharton
                     • She read a story about an MBA student who tripped while jogging in Fairmount Park and found an ancient gold coin in the underbrush. It was an old Viking coin that was appraised at $77,500
                     • She realized that she could set up a profitable business that rented out portable Metal Detectors to people that wanted to search Fairmount Park for more Viking relics
                     • Also, Park had the idea of stocking her store with &quot;sundries,&quot; such as water bottles and energy bars, that she could sell at a huge mark-up to renters before their expedition into the park Park prepared a business plan and approached a fellow student, Jay Girard, who had a sizable trust fund and who she believed would invest in this new venture
                     • Due to his myriad of other investments, and his heavy course load, Girard agreed to invest as a silent partner and allow Park to run the business, which she named Relic Spotter Inc.</span>

                  <li>
                     <span>(1) On April 1, 2012, Girard decided to invest $200,000 and Park put up $50,000 to purchase a total of 25,000 shares in the new company. The par value of the shares was $1.00</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <span>(2) Lacking the funds for her initial investment, Park borrowed the $50,000 from the Imperial Bank of Philadelphia on April 1, using her parent&#039;s house as collateral</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <span>(3) On April 2, Park hired a lawyer to have the business incorporated. Because this was a fairly simple organization, the legal fees were only $3,900</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <span>(4) To house the business, Park bought an abandoned pizza parlor near Fairmount Park for $155,000 on April 7. The building was old and needed renovation work. The purchase documents allocated $103,000 to the land and $52,000 to the building. Park paid for the building with $31,000 cash and a $124,000 mortgage from the Imperial Bank</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(5) Park felt that some renovation work would extend the life of the building to 25 years (with an expected salvage value of $10,000). She ordered the renovation work, costing $33,000, to begin immediately. The work was completed on May 25, at which time she paid in cash the amount owed for the renovations</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(6) Park phoned a number of metal detector vendors until she found one that was willing to give her a volume discount. On June 2, Park purchased 240 metal detectors at an average cost of $500 per unit ($120,000 total). The innovation in the industry is so rapid that Park felt the units would only last for two years, at which time they would have no remaining value</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(7) On June 15, Park ordered $2,000 of sundries inventory (e.g., water bottles, energy bars, etc.) to be delivered on June 30. Park was able to purchase the inventory &quot;on account&quot;, which meant she had up to 30 days after delivery to pay the supplier</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(8) On June 30, Park paid $2,100 for a three-year site license to use geo-contour mapping software in the metal detectors</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(9) On June 30, Park signed a contract with a local advertising agency to provide various forms of advertising for a period of one year. She paid $8,000 upfront for advertising through June 30, 2013</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(10) On June 30, Park needed cash to make a payment on the Imperial Bank loan that funded her purchase of Relic Spotter stock. She borrowed $5,000 from Relic Spotter at 10% interest, with the principal and interest due in a lump sum on June 30, 2013</span>
                     <ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(11) On June 30, Park also hired two employees, Linda Carlyle and Charlotte Cafferly, to run the shop. They signed employment contracts promising each salaries of $32,000 per year</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(12) On June 30, Girard called from St. Tropez to check in on the business. Upon hearing that Relic Spotter only had $47,000 of cash left in the bank, Girard became concerned about his investment.
                     Thinking fast, Park stated that she was so confident of Relic Spotter&#039;s prospects that she was declaring a $0.10 per share dividend, to be paid on August 31 ($2,500). This dividend seemed to reassure Girard</span>
                     <ol>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <span>(13) Relic Spotter opened for business on July 1, 2012, just in time for the big Independence Day weekend. On July 31, Park paid the supplier the $2,000 it was owed</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(14) On August 31, Park paid the $2,500 dividend that had been declared in June</span>

                     </ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(15) In a search for new revenue opportunities, Park initiated an unlimited rental arrangement with the Penn Antiquities Club on December 1, 2012. Under this arrangement, the club paid Relic Spotter $1,200 cash upfront for unlimited rentals over the next year</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(16) For the six months ended December 31, 2012, rental revenues on the metal detectors totaled $124,300. Most of the rentals were paid in cash immediately. However, as an initiative to reward repeat customers, Park allowed a select number of frequent renters to charge their rentals and be billed later. As of December 31, 2012, $4,200 was outstanding under this plan</span>
                     <ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(17) During the period between July 1 and December 31, Park purchased $40,000 of sundries inventory, of which $38,000 had been paid in cash and $2,000 was still owed at December 31</span>
                     <ol>
                     </ol>

                  <li>
                     <span>(18) Relic Spotter recorded sales of sundries totaling $35,000 for the six months ended December 31, all received in cash</span>

                     <span>(21) When Park called her accountant on December 31, 2012, she was pleased to tell him that the company had $78,800 in cash. She wanted to go out to celebrate, but the accountant reminded her that she needed to stay in to do adjusting entries. For example, even though it wasn&#039;t paid in cash, accrued interest on the mortgage was $4,900</span>

                  <li>
                     <span>(22) The accountant said that depreciation needed to be recorded on the building (Park was confused by this because she received an unsolicited letter from a mortgage broker informing her that the building had increased in value to $120,000)
                     Recall that, in transaction (5), Park renovated the building, bringing its original cost to $85,000. She also determined that the useful life of the building was 25 years, with an expected salvage value of $10,000</span>

                  <li>
                     <span>(23) The accountant also noted that Park needed to record depreciation on the metal detectors
                     Recall that, in transaction (6), Park purchased $120,000 of metal detectors. She determined that the units would only last for two years, at which time they would have no remaining value</span>

                           <span>Our stock-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with the interests of our shareholders. Stock options and restricted stock units (RSU) are granted to employees under the shareholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).
                           We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method using a Black-Scholes valuation model. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term. The fair value of stock option grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, generally three years.
                           RSU expense is based on the fair value of PupCo stock on the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting period, generally three years. Each RSU is settled in a share of our stock after the vesting period.</span>

Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect that would occur if in-the-money employee stock options were exercised and RSUs and preferred shares were converted into common shares. Options to purchase 24.4 million shares in 2012 and 39.0 million shares in 2011 were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because these options were out-of-the-money.</span></li>
