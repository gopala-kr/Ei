      - 14% of the U.S. population remains disconnected to the web.
      - With a current world estimated population of 7.8 billion, there are approximately 4.79 billion people worldwide who have access to and use the internet frequently. That means that 61.4% of the world population uses the internet. 
      - From the year 2000 to 2019, the usage of the internet increased by 1,157%.  
      - As of June 2019, the world region of Asia accounts for the majority of internet users in the world. 2,300,469,859 people in Asia are online, which makes up 50.7% of the global internet population.
      - 89.4% of America and 87.7% of Europe has access to and uses the internet on a daily basis. Both regions have some of the highest internet penetration rates. 
      - Countries in the Middle East have seen a 5,243% growth in internet usage since 2010.
      - There are currently 351.8 million registered domain names in the world.
      - 35% of all websites are using WordPress as their content management system.  That's over 60 million websites.
