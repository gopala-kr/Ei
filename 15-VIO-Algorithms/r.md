NASA invests into swarms for space exploration

Robots will be used in research projects that NASA’s Autonomy Research Center for STEAHM is collaborating for missions such as exploring the Martian surface and voids. A swarm of simple, small robots can complete complex tasks much more efficiently and effectively than a single large rover![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111886813-8dc69b80-89c8-11eb-80ea-d01bf1c40346.png)

Environmental monitoring through biomimics

The Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering designed a 1,400-pound autonomous crab that can reach an underwater depth of 656 feet. It doesn't stir up clouds of silt and debris, such as propeller-driven remotely operated underwater vehicles. The crab also has a doppler radar-based navigation system so that it can feel around in murky conditions. With its several cameras it can zoom in on essential objects and species to see events at the deepest depths.

5G & AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

The CTO of Waymo, which started life as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, believes that 5G is a crucial “enabler”, when it comes to developing the company’s autonomous car fleets. O2 has also now announced a project to trial driverless cars in London using its 5G network.  The UK's second-biggest phone network has partnered with the Smart Mobility Living Lab - a research organisation comprised of experts from the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), DG Cities, Cisco, and Loughborough University - to develop what it claims to be the ‘most advanced driverless testbed in the world’. The aim is to develop a road management system with the focus on a 10 percent reduction in the time that motorists spend in traffic. Other figures include a positive benefit to the economy of £880m a year from improved productivity as well as the reduction of CO2 emissions by 370,000 metric tonnes a year.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111886934-923f8400-89c9-11eb-8c29-9bac441fbcd8.png)

FAURECIA 

Faurecia and Accenture are combining innovation expertise and co-investing to develop and scale products and services for connected and autonomous vehicles. The collaboration focuses on cognitive technologies to reinvent the on-board user experience, as well as services to enhance comfort and wellness. Its first initiative integrated Amazon Alexa voice technology within the cockpit and entertainment system of connected vehicles, distinguishing between different users. For example, drivers and passengers can control elements of the cockpit with their voice and tap into their Alexa services in the home to update shopping lists. They can even heat up their car while in the house. Accenture and Faurecia will make the cockpit multi-AI compliant and take new technologies to the next level to shape the future of the automotive industry. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111886939-9c618280-89c9-11eb-9127-45e836ee2388.png)

UBER REDEFINES THE RIDESHARE BUSINESS MODEL

Mobile technology enabled Uber to reinvent the taxi model and create a supply of drivers and vehicles and bring significant efficiencies in pricing and driver-rider pairing. Uber is now testing autonomous vehicles so the company can own a fleet of vehicles to service customers.  
Uber’s business model has already evolved into logistics from pure transportation with the addition of food delivery with UberEats. Operations transformation is seeing the developing and testing of autonomous vehicles through a partnership with Toyota and Volvo. Disruptive technologies deployed to manage and operate a fleet will include AI, Deep Learning, Automation, IoT, 5G & Pico Cells, Data Storage Density. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111886973-c0bd5f00-89c9-11eb-90e0-2ad05ba52ef5.png)

Autonomous Vehicles/Connected Car

5G provides new opportunities to deploy autonomous driving and connected car applications. Use cases include vehicle data transmission and remote autonomous vehicle control on any road, in any conditions, without a human on board - requiring 5G network characteristics including broad coverage, high data throughput, ultra-low latency, and core network slicing. Automated vehicle start-up Pelaton would benefit from increased 5G speeds, as would connected car start-up Mojio. The Tesla’s, Waymo’s and Uber’s of the world would benefit from better communication with sensor-enabled infrastructure/traffic systems.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111886977-d0d53e80-89c9-11eb-8c1c-37d77c1e9385.png)

V2X Communications

Connecting cars to each other and their surroundings, often known as V2X communications, is a key step in the safe, large-scale deployment of self-driving cars. Jaguar Land Rover is testing smart, connected cars on UK roads to prepare for self-driving cars. The tests on over 40 miles of public roads are part of a $12.6 million project aimed at creating the UK’s first fully self-driving car connected infrastructure. Vehicles will benefit from a combination of wireless technologies (3/4G, WiFi, fibre optic networks). This technology can provide warnings to drivers that a car too far ahead to see has applied its breaks, for example, to avoid potential accidents. Audi partnered with Huawei and plans to launch 5G-connected cars in early 2020, allowing for V2X vehicle communications for safer, semi-autonomous driving. The car will be able to communicate with traffic lights, cameras and road signs, and direct the user to the specified destination.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111886985-da5ea680-89c9-11eb-90f0-0ccc29684ad5.png)

Autonomous Mining Trucks

In manufacturing and industry, OEMs are doing a lot to drive uptake – Caterpillar, the construction machinery and equipment company, first deployed autonomous mining trucks in 2013. The Cat Command platform implements autonomous hauling solutions for truck fleets. Komatsu, another heavy equipment provider, makes hauling trucks for surface mining with autonomous capabilities – in 2016, the company unveiled a prototype cab-less mining truck. BHP Billiton, the mining company, deploys a range of autonomous vehicles, including underground trains and surface mine trucks.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111886991-e2b6e180-89c9-11eb-9fb7-d1fbe64c0e31.png)

Autonomous Passenger Cars

Autonomous passenger cars, whereby individuals own/lease private cars is a key potential use case for AV, providing opportunities to reduce accidents caused by human error, and for better traffic congestion management. Usage-based insurance will have more data to analyse with customized insurance products tailored to individual customers. Several companies have made significant investments to assemble the portfolio of technologies needed to realize their autonomous vehicle plans. Intel is acquiring Mobileye for $15 billion, Ford motor company is investing $1 billion in Argo AI, Uber acquired Otto, and General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft for autonomous vehicle development and acquired Cruise Automation.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111886997-ea768600-89c9-11eb-88c6-4a076537650e.png)

Autonomous Cargo Truck Platooning

Automated cargo truck platooning (a truck platoon with 3-4 driverless trailer trucks) will reduce number of human drivers needed and tackle challenges related to variable fuel costs and rising insurance costs caused by human error (accidents). In most scenarios, a lead truck is equipped with a 2x4K camera in the front and 2x4K cameras in the back, while trailer trucks are equipped with 4x4K cameras placed on the sides.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111886999-f19d9400-89c9-11eb-8fae-251fd4e1da9a.png)


---------------------

Autonomous Public Transport

Automated shuttle busses, used for specific public facilities, such as airports and campuses (known routes) would service to reduce number of human drivers needed, reduce salary costs and provide flexibility in adding more buses to address capacity. A remote human operator would likely be required to see the full status of a bus en route as well as performance indicators. Autonomous public busses, with many routes and frequent route changes, could also be used to reduce accidents and insurance costs, and maintenance costs caused by poor driving. Autonomous taxi services - in countries like Japan and Korea, taxi fleets are owned by corporations and scheduling could follow an Uber-like cloud-based architecture.
