Obeta uses covarients dynamic picking arms

Covariant is tackling the issue of picking any size package with relatively simple hardware, including an off-the-shelf industrial arm , a suction gripper and a 2D camera system that doesn’t rely on lasers or pattern projection. What makes the system work is a neural network that identifies the object to be picked up. 
The system is deployed in a warehouse that handles logistics for a Obeta, which overnights orders of electrical supplies to electricians in Germany![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111887778-48f23300-89cf-11eb-9040-3e2da73ac6a5.png)

Fedex Memphis accelerates robot arm deployment

FedEx installed a quartet of robotic arms from Yaskawa America with the express intent of helping sort the massive numbers of parcels that pass through its Memphis facility. With the advent of Covid19, a majority of its shipments are being routed through this facility to protect its workforce from contact-based infections. The company says several members of its Small Package Sort System team — who previously did the sorting themselves — are operating as supervisors for the new robotic employees.
