5G & AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

The CTO of Waymo, which started life as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, believes that 5G is a crucial “enabler”, when it comes to developing the company’s autonomous car fleets. O2 has also now announced a project to trial driverless cars in London using its 5G network.  The UK's second-biggest phone network has partnered with the Smart Mobility Living Lab - a research organisation comprised of experts from the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), DG Cities, Cisco, and Loughborough University - to develop what it claims to be the ‘most advanced driverless testbed in the world’. The aim is to develop a road management system with the focus on a 10 percent reduction in the time that motorists spend in traffic. Other figures include a positive benefit to the economy of £880m a year from improved productivity as well as the reduction of CO2 emissions by 370,000 metric tonnes a year.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111230819-1c5da600-85e0-11eb-84f9-6f54fbee8672.png)

V2X Communications

Connecting cars to each other and their surroundings, often known as V2X communications, is a key step in the safe, large-scale deployment of self-driving cars. Jaguar Land Rover is testing smart, connected cars on UK roads to prepare for self-driving cars. The tests on over 40 miles of public roads are part of a $12.6 million project aimed at creating the UK’s first fully self-driving car connected infrastructure. Vehicles will benefit from a combination of wireless technologies (3/4G, WiFi, fibre optic networks). This technology can provide warnings to drivers that a car too far ahead to see has applied its breaks, for example, to avoid potential accidents. Audi partnered with Huawei and plans to launch 5G-connected cars in early 2020, allowing for V2X vehicle communications for safer, semi-autonomous driving. The car will be able to communicate with traffic lights, cameras and road signs, and direct the user to the specified destination.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111231047-79f1f280-85e0-11eb-9fcc-a561c63c3bc5.png)

Autonomous Passenger Cars

Autonomous passenger cars, whereby individuals own/lease private cars is a key potential use case for AV, providing opportunities to reduce accidents caused by human error, and for better traffic congestion management. Usage-based insurance will have more data to analyse with customized insurance products tailored to individual customers. Several companies have made significant investments to assemble the portfolio of technologies needed to realize their autonomous vehicle plans. Intel is acquiring Mobileye for $15 billion, Ford motor company is investing $1 billion in Argo AI, Uber acquired Otto, and General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft for autonomous vehicle development and acquired Cruise Automation.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111231120-9a21b180-85e0-11eb-9aa7-51893119743a.png)


--------------------------

Autonomous Cargo Truck Platooning

Automated cargo truck platooning (a truck platoon with 3-4 driverless trailer trucks) will reduce number of human drivers needed and tackle challenges related to variable fuel costs and rising insurance costs caused by human error (accidents). In most scenarios, a lead truck is equipped with a 2x4K camera in the front and 2x4K cameras in the back, while trailer trucks are equipped with 4x4K cameras placed on the sides.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111231138-a4dc4680-85e0-11eb-8ed1-41c00469cb41.png)



-------------------

Autonomous Public Transport

Automated shuttle busses, used for specific public facilities, such as airports and campuses (known routes) would service to reduce number of human drivers needed, reduce salary costs and provide flexibility in adding more buses to address capacity. A remote human operator would likely be required to see the full status of a bus en route as well as performance indicators. Autonomous public busses, with many routes and frequent route changes, could also be used to reduce accidents and insurance costs, and maintenance costs caused by poor driving. Autonomous taxi services - in countries like Japan and Korea, taxi fleets are owned by corporations and scheduling could follow an Uber-like cloud-based architecture.
