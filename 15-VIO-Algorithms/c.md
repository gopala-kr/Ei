Briggs Automotive Company is developing a morphable wing for its supercar that adjusts to external weather conditions and automatically adjusts in order to provide maximum downforce to the car.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/114919967-8d45e700-9e46-11eb-893d-67dfcd769c63.png)
