V2X Communications
Connecting cars to each other and their surroundings, often known as V2X communications, is a key step in the safe, large-scale deployment of self-driving cars. Jaguar Land Rover is testing smart, connected cars on UK roads to prepare for self-driving cars. The tests on over 40 miles of public roads are part of a $12.6 million project aimed at creating the UK’s first fully self-driving car connected infrastructure. Vehicles will benefit from a combination of wireless technologies (3/4G, WiFi, fibre optic networks). This technology can provide warnings to drivers that a car too far ahead to see has applied its breaks, for example, to avoid potential accidents. Audi partnered with Huawei and plans to launch 5G-connected cars in early 2020, allowing for V2X vehicle communications for safer, semi-autonomous driving. The car will be able to communicate with traffic lights, cameras and road signs, and direct the user to the specified destination.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/114921947-b9fafe00-9e48-11eb-8fbf-bb9ae4af69e8.png)

Smart Parking
As urbanisation continues apace and the number of cars on the roads rises steadily, finding a place to park can be a major headache for business and leisure travellers alike. If drivers knew in advance which spaces are vacant, they would spend less time and waste less fuel searching for a place to park.
Using new low power wide area (LPWA) mobile technologies, it will become cost-effective for telecoms operators to relay real-time information on parking availability to drivers’ smartphones or dashboard computers. Deutsche Telekom has tested a prototype LPWA – based parking system on its campus in Bonn in Germany, and trialled it on its commercial network in the Netherlands.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/114922144-f890b880-9e48-11eb-8fe4-df00f11be7fc.png)
