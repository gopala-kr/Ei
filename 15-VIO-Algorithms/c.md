Using Boston Dynamics Spot for Healthcare monitoring

Boston Dynamics, an autonomous robot making company is contributing to the pandemic through autonomous robot-dog named Spot to help protect healthcare workers from Covid-19 at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts. With the help of an iPad and two-way radio on the robot, healthcare workers video conference with patients and remotely control Spot as the robot dog walks through rooms with infected or potentially infected patients![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111230398-79a52780-85df-11eb-9845-e1d1b8c839cb.png)

Nuro launches autonomous last-mile delivery services

Nuro allows millions of people to have groceries and other goods delivered by autonomous vehicles, potentially reducing traffic. Its driverless R1 pod is comprised of compartments that can be filled with goods for delivery to homes. Nuro is breaking new ground and building their AV from scratch. This US Department of Transportation (DOT) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) approved a regulatory exemption for R2, Nuro’s second-generation vehicle![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111230455-8e81bb00-85df-11eb-9a70-daa632c8f80c.png)

Autonomous Disinfection at Gerald R Ford airport Michigan

Pratt Miller Mobility demonstrated its Large Area Autonomous Disinfecting (LAAD) vehicle at the Gerald R. Ford International Airport. LAAD is the first vehicle of its kind to be deployed in the U.S. Described as a “connected, electric and autonomous disinfecting robot,” LAAD uses a multi-head electrostatic sprayer array to dispense disinfecting materials![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111230663-e1f40900-85df-11eb-871a-33c90ddb81cf.png)

NASA to deploy self driving tech on mars

NASA is expected to launch its latest Mars rover, Perseverance, on a first-of-its-kind mission to collect and store geological samples. Perseverance is significantly more autonomous than any of NASA’s previous four rovers and is designed be a “self-driving car on Mars.” Like the ones on Earth, it will navigate using an array of sensors feeding data to machine vision algorithms![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111230703-f0422500-85df-11eb-86a1-f2f953d77ae0.png)

Environmental monitoring through biomimics

The Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering designed a 1,400-pound autonomous crab that can reach an underwater depth of 656 feet. It doesn't stir up clouds of silt and debris, such as propeller-driven remotely operated underwater vehicles. The crab also has a doppler radar-based navigation system so that it can feel around in murky conditions. With its several cameras it can zoom in on essential objects and species to see events at the deepest depths.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111230784-110a7a80-85e0-11eb-9e53-37a62459af6d.png)

5G & AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

The CTO of Waymo, which started life as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, believes that 5G is a crucial “enabler”, when it comes to developing the company’s autonomous car fleets. O2 has also now announced a project to trial driverless cars in London using its 5G network.  The UK's second-biggest phone network has partnered with the Smart Mobility Living Lab - a research organisation comprised of experts from the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), DG Cities, Cisco, and Loughborough University - to develop what it claims to be the ‘most advanced driverless testbed in the world’. The aim is to develop a road management system with the focus on a 10 percent reduction in the time that motorists spend in traffic. Other figures include a positive benefit to the economy of £880m a year from improved productivity as well as the reduction of CO2 emissions by 370,000 metric tonnes a year.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111230819-1c5da600-85e0-11eb-84f9-6f54fbee8672.png)

Autonomous Cars at BMW

The BMW Research, New Technologies & Innovations team in Garching (Germany) is working on neuromorphic computing, cognitive modeling for knowledge representation of automotive scenes and machine learning in the context of automated driving. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111230861-2da6b280-85e0-11eb-9916-37d3576b6b89.png)

TRAFFIC OPTIMIZATION

The management and optimization of traffic (road, rail, air, etc.), the operation of vehicle fleets and the management of autonomous vehicles are promising fields where the inherent qualities of Quantum could well express their potential. Several companies are evaluating this around the optimization of filling of airline fleets in near real time and in a global way.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111230931-4adb8100-85e0-11eb-98c5-eb6e340a0991.png)

UBER REDEFINES THE RIDESHARE BUSINESS MODEL

Mobile technology enabled Uber to reinvent the taxi model and create a supply of drivers and vehicles and bring significant efficiencies in pricing and driver-rider pairing. Uber is now testing autonomous vehicles so the company can own a fleet of vehicles to service customers.  
Uber’s business model has already evolved into logistics from pure transportation with the addition of food delivery with UberEats. Operations transformation is seeing the developing and testing of autonomous vehicles through a partnership with Toyota and Volvo. Disruptive technologies deployed to manage and operate a fleet will include AI, Deep Learning, Automation, IoT, 5G & Pico Cells, Data Storage Density. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111230967-57f87000-85e0-11eb-8479-d4ad9b2a55fc.png)

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

Amazon's drones will be able to pick up a package and track the location of the customer it is being delivered to by pulling data from their smartphone. They expect to deliver up to 400 million packages per year at a price of one dollar per delivery. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111230995-647cc880-85e0-11eb-97e2-d973b86e8d4f.png)

Autonomous Vehicles/Connected Car

5G provides new opportunities to deploy autonomous driving and connected car applications. Use cases include vehicle data transmission and remote autonomous vehicle control on any road, in any conditions, without a human on board - requiring 5G network characteristics including broad coverage, high data throughput, ultra-low latency, and core network slicing. Automated vehicle start-up Pelaton would benefit from increased 5G speeds, as would connected car start-up Mojio. The Tesla’s, Waymo’s and Uber’s of the world would benefit from better communication with sensor-enabled infrastructure/traffic systems.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111231020-6d6d9a00-85e0-11eb-85e6-e2b94c4f4da7.png)

V2X Communications

Connecting cars to each other and their surroundings, often known as V2X communications, is a key step in the safe, large-scale deployment of self-driving cars. Jaguar Land Rover is testing smart, connected cars on UK roads to prepare for self-driving cars. The tests on over 40 miles of public roads are part of a $12.6 million project aimed at creating the UK’s first fully self-driving car connected infrastructure. Vehicles will benefit from a combination of wireless technologies (3/4G, WiFi, fibre optic networks). This technology can provide warnings to drivers that a car too far ahead to see has applied its breaks, for example, to avoid potential accidents. Audi partnered with Huawei and plans to launch 5G-connected cars in early 2020, allowing for V2X vehicle communications for safer, semi-autonomous driving. The car will be able to communicate with traffic lights, cameras and road signs, and direct the user to the specified destination.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4322266/111231047-79f1f280-85e0-11eb-9fcc-a561c63c3bc5.png)
